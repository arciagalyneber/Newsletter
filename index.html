				<p>New characters have also been revealed for the threequel, with Jamal Sims playing The Princess and the Frog's villain Dr Facilier, Jadah Marie starring as his daughter Celia, and American Horror Story's Cheyenne Jackson as Hercules villain Hades.

Descendants 3 plot: What is it about?
After an epic battle between Mal and Uma as a giant octopus and dragon, respectively, Descendants 2 ended with Mal reuniting with Ben, Uma swimming away, Mal giving her spell book to the Fairy Godmother and Dizzy accepting an offer to attend Auradon Prep with everyone else.

Again, we have nothing official in terms of plot for Descendants 3 just yet (besides the teaser that Mal will be reunited with her as-yet-unknown dad that is), so until then we have nothing to do but speculate.
Expect anything more to be released closer to the film's premiere date, and we can probably look forward to a new song from the movie coming with it too, like how 'Ways to Be Wicked' was released with the trailer.
